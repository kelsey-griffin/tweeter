      Hey!<br>
      Tweeter App Under Construction!!!!<br> 
      Come Back Later!!!<br>
      Stars shining bright above you
      Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
      Birds singing in the sycamore tree
      Dream a little dream of me
      Say "Night-ie night" and kiss me
      Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
      While I'm alone and blue as can be
      Dream a little dream of me
      Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
      Still craving your kiss
      I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
      Just saying this
      Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
      Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
      But in your dreams whatever they be
      Dream a little dream of me
      Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
      Still craving your kiss
      I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
      Just saying this
      Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
      Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
      But in your dreams whatever they be
      Dream a little dream of me
      Stars shining bright above you
      Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
      Birds singing in the sycamore tree
      Dream a little dream of me
      Say "Night-ie night" and kiss me
      Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
